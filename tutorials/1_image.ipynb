The sign of the eigenvalue fully determines whether a feature will contribute positively or negatively. Eigenvectors with positive eigenvalues generally represent specific parts of digits that we expect (and have seen until now). Negative eigenvectors are somewhat less intuitive; they generally represent specific parts that are most destructive towards classifying a given digit, which is often hard to understand. Consider the digit 4; if one were to add a vertical line between the top parts, it would most likely be a 9. Hence, it makes sense for the model to strongly negatively match this region.\n",

        "The decomposition above is only one way to analyze the interaction matrices. A good decomposition satisfies two criteria: short and interpretable. We satisfy the second criterion by considering features per digit, which are generally easier to understand. However, it may miss shared features, specific strokes that occur in multiple digits, which the model leverages. In that sense, our decomposition could be shorter. This becomes especially important when scaling up. It's currently somewhat unclear what the best way is to achieve both criteria. One possibility is dictionary learning, not SAEs, but rather 'Ye Olde' Lasso Regression.\n",

At each step, we compute eigenvectors and use those as output directions for the next layers. One could perform a sort of beam search to extract the most important global directions. However, this leverages no shared features in the model, which is suboptimal. Clustering could possibly help in this."
